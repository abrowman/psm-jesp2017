I would define it by respect and success in life. So to me status is how much respect one garners form others in society. I think in economic terms as well. Higher income people tend to get more respect because of the power they hold. So to me it is a combination of monetary wealth and respect one gets from others.,,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

They make me think that we put a lot of emphasis on status and that promotes a sense of entitled ego that doesn't allow others to have better lives. Since people associate so much with their status they want it to be higher than their peers to make themselves feel better.

"Socioeconomic ladders are complicated because those with the power will always have the authority unless the 'little man' rises against. But those with 'status' keep those without status separated with fear, hate, and fundamentals. Status rarely changes in the United States from generation to generation. There are rare cases, and there are times people can work towards gaining rungs on that social ladder, but that is rare and few in between. I am of the mindset​ that ONLY I can do nothing.
